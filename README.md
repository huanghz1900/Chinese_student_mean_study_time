What is the average study time for Chinese students?
From 2014 to 2020, middle school students studied between 53 and 56 hours per week, while high school students averaged 66 to 68 hours per week, according to CFPS data. 
This exceeds even the demands of '996'. Many interviewed high schoolers report getting less than 6 hours of sleep a night. 
As educational returns diminish in an increasingly competitive environment, student fatigue is deepening. 
The heavy study load has become one of the biggest challenges in China’s education system.
In just two years, the average weekly study time for students in non-provincial capital cities increased from 66.2 hours to 67.5 hours, 
narrowing the 'gap' with county-level students from 1.1 hours to just 0.3 hours.
This means that it's not just the 'small-town exam grinders' anymore—more and more urban students are being forced into becoming 'small-city exam grinders.'
